## 1: Ethical Business Plan

### 1.A. Company Name of Fictitious Company

**JobMatch AI**  

JobMatch AI is a startup focused on creating a fair, transparent, and inclusive hiring platform. Our technology uses artificial intelligence to match job seekers with employers based on skills, qualifications, and experience — while removing personal identifiers such as name, gender, race, or age to mitigate bias and promote equitable opportunity.


### 1.B. Long-Term Vision Statement

#### 1.B.1 Goals

The primary goal of JobMatch AI is to eliminate unconscious bias in recruitment and give every qualified candidate a fair chance at employment. We aim to build a platform that becomes the industry standard for fair hiring practices globally. In the next five years, we want to integrate with at least 500 companies, help place over one million candidates into jobs, and improve workplace diversity metrics by measurable amounts.

#### 1.B.2 Idea Origination

This idea was born from personal experiences and observations of inequality in hiring. Several of our founding members have seen talented candidates overlooked because of gender, ethnicity, or simply the way their names appeared on a résumé. Inspired by coursework in AI ethics and industry reports on bias in recruitment, we decided to build a system that leverages machine learning for good — using technology not just for efficiency but for fairness..

#### 1.B.3 Purpose/Values/Mission
Our purpose is to make hiring fair and equitable for everyone. We value transparency, diversity, accountability, and privacy. Our mission is to create a recruitment platform that removes irrelevant barriers, empowers candidates, and helps employers build stronger, more diverse teams.

#### 1.B.4 Key Questions
- How can we ensure that AI reduces bias instead of amplifying it?
- How do we make sure our platform remains transparent and accountable to candidates and employers?
- What measurable impact can we have on workforce diversity in the next five years?

### 1.C. Strategy with Ethical Impacts AND Ethical Safeguards

Below are the three primary OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) that will guide JobMatch AI over the next 3–5 years.


#### Other OKR 

#### 1.C.3.1 OKR 3 Objective and Key Result (John)
**Objective:** Build transparency and accountability into the hiring process through explainable AI features.  

**Key Results:**  
- 100% of matches generated by the platform will include a human-readable explanation.  
- Conduct annual transparency reports made public on our website.  
- Increase recruiter trust score by 20% through surveys after explainability features launch.

#### 1.C.3.2 OKR 3 Metric(s) with Experiment(s)
Metrics include transparency report readership, recruiter trust survey scores, and frequency of candidate inquiries requesting explanations (target: <5% unresolved inquiries). Experiments include usability studies to test clarity of explanations.

#### 1.C.3.3 OKR 3 Ethical Impact(s)/Issues(s)
Opaque AI systems can create accountability gaps and perpetuate systemic discrimination without visibility. If candidates don’t understand why they were not matched, trust in the system will erode.

#### 1.C.3.4 OKR 3 Ethical Safeguards
We will adopt explainable AI frameworks and publish clear documentation of model decision-making. We will include an appeals process for candidates and external audits of system outputs.
